Makers Solar Harvesting Project, Pieze, Wurth, Energy Harvesting Designs for the IoT
 
All processes that involve energy conversion are, to some degree, inefficient. Motors get hot, as do power transistors, automobile engines, and light bulbs; in each case energy is wasted as heat.</description>

      <description>Motion-powered charging involves the transformation of naturally occurring motion in the form of kinetic energy into electricity which can be used to charge batteries and power electronic devices.   Research Copenhagen Wheel, Vint Cerf&amp;rsquo;s Taking the Internet to the Next Physical Level, Self-charging Textile
 
Ampy Move is a wearable motion-charger that transforms the kinetic energy from motion into power for smartphone and wearables. Inductors in the Move device transform movement into usable power to charge devices.</description>
