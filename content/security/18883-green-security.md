__Ubiquitous computing__ (or "ubicomp") is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. __Green computing__ is the environmentally responsible and eco-friendly use of computers and their resources.

In [IEEE 1888.](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1888.3-2013.html), security requirements, system security architecture definitions, and a standardized description of authentication and authorization, along with security procedures and protocols, are specified. This standard can help avoid unintended data disclosure to the public and unauthorized access to resources, while providing enhanced integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data in the ubiquitous green community control network.

The [IEEE 1888](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1888-2014.html) standard identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storage for archiving and developing data sharing platforms, and application units as important system components for developing digital communities, i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways, storage, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration of multiple facilities, data storage, application services such as central management, energy saving, environmental monitoring, and alarm notification systems.
