Although inductive charging with an induction coil is the most common form of wireless charging, [uBeam](http://ubeam.com/technology/) is pioneering an ultrasound method, [HumaVox](http://www.humavox.com/our-technology/) uses near-field radio frequency resonance and [WiTricity](http://witricity.com/technology/) uses Magnetic Resonance.

Inductive charging (also known as wireless charging or cordless charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects through electromagnetic induction. This is usually done with a charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device.

Induction chargers use an induction coil to create an alternating electromagnetic field from within a charging base, and a second induction coil in the portable device takes power from the electromagnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the battery. The two induction coils in proximity combine to form an electrical transformer. Greater distances between sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses resonant inductive coupling.

Recent improvements to this resonant system include using a movable transmission coil (i.e. mounted on an elevating platform or arm) and the use of other materials for the receiver coil made of silver plated copper or sometimes aluminium to minimize weight and decrease resistance due to the skin effect.

[Qi](https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/), an interface standard developed by the Wireless Power Consortium for inductive electrical power transfer. At the time of July 2017, it is the most famous standard in the world, more than 200 million devices supporting this interface.
