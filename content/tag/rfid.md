In 2009, Kevin Ashton, who cofounded the Auto-ID Center researching RFID, wrote an article in the RFID Journal titled "[That 'Internet of Things' Thing](http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986)". He is attributed with having coined the IoT term then.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy from a nearby RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. 

RFID tags are used in many industries, for example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets allows for positive identification of animals. Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.

##### Security and Privacy
[ISO/IEC 18000](https://www.iso.org/standard/46149.html) and [ISO/IEC 29167](https://www.iso.org/standard/55847.html) use on-chip cryptography methods for untraceability, tag and reader authentication, and over-the-air privacy. [ISO/IEC 20248](https://www.iso.org/standard/67412.html) specifies a digital signature data structure for RFID and barcodes providing data, source and read method authenticity. This work is done within [ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31](https://www.iso.org/committee/45332.html) Automatic identification and data capture techniques.
