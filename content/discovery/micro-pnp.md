##### Abstract

Internet of Things (IoT) applications require diverse sensors and actuators. However, contemporary IoT devices provide limited support for the integration of third-party peripherals. To tackle this problem, we introduce μPnP: a hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices. μPnP provides support for: driver development, automatic integration of third-party peripherals, discovery and remote access to peripheral services. This is achieved through a low-cost hardware identification approach, a lightweight driver language and a multicast network architecture. Evaluation shows that μPnP has a minimal memory footprint, reduces development effort and provides true plug-and-play integration at orders of magnitude less energy than USB.
