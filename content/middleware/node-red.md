Node-RED is a flow-based development tool developed originally by IBM for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things.

Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor, which can be used to create JavaScript functions. Elements of applications can be saved or shared for re-use. The runtime is built on Node.js. The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON. Since version 0.14 MQTT nodes can make properly configured TLS connections.

In 2016, IBM contributed Node-RED as an open source JS Foundation project.
