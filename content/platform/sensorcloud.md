SensorCloud is a unique sensor data storage, visualization and remote management platform that leverages powerful Cloud computing technologies to provide excellent data scalability, rapid visualization, and user programmable analysis. SensorCloud's core features include FastGraph, [MathEngine](http://www.sensorcloud.com/mathengine), LiveConnect, and the [OpenData API](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/SensorCloud/blob/master/API/README.md).

LORD MicroStrain's Wireless and Inertial sensors allow instant uploading of their data to SensorCloud. Third party devices and other data sources can also push data to SensorCloud via the OpenData API or via the provided CSV uploader. Once uploaded, your data is securely stored in the Cloud and can be accessed from anywhere, or downloaded for offline use.

Alerts are provided to help notify you of real-time events in your data. MathEngine analytics allow you to perform both simple and complex mathematical operations on your data, all in the Cloud. [Read more](http://www.sensorcloud.com/documentation)
