Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.

Specifically, Solid is:

* A tech stack -- a set of complementary
  [standards](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec#standards-used) and
  [data formats/vocabularies](https://github.com/solid/vocab) that together
  provide capabilities that are currently available only through centralized
  social media services (think Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/many others), such as
  *identity*, *authentication and login*, *authorization and permission lists*,
  *contact management*, *messaging and notifications*, *feed aggregation and
  subscription*, *comments and discussions*, and more.
* A **[Specifications document](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec)**
  that describes a REST API that extends those existing
  standards, contains design notes on the individual components used, and is
  intended as a guide for developers who plan to build servers or applications.
* A set of [servers](https://github.com/solid/solid-platform#servers) that
  implement this specification.
* A [test suite](https://github.com/solid/solid-tests) for testing and validating
  Solid implementations.
* An ecosystem of [social apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps),
  [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list) and helper
  libraries (such as [solid.js](https://github.com/solid/solid.js)) that run on
  the Solid platform.
* A community providing documentation, discussion (see the
  [solid gitter channel](https://gitter.im/solid/solid)),
  [tutorials](https://github.com/solid/solid#tutorials) and
  [talks/presentations](https://github.com/solid/talks).
