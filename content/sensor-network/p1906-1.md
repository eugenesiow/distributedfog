A nanoscale communication network is a human-designed system for communicating at or with the nanoscale, using physical principles that are suited to nanoscale systems. 

"Human-designed" means a system that occurs as a result of conscious human intervention. For clarity, human-designed systems may include naturally occurring components in an arrangement or for a purpose that is not otherwise naturally occurring. 

Communication is the act of conveying a message from a transmitting party to a receiving party. This includes the components of message, transmitter, receiver, medium, and message carriers. In nanoscale communication at one to a few nanometers (nm), in the atomic range, local realism may be altered by quantum principles and include quantum entanglement. Communication includes systems with many transmitters and many receivers, for example broadcast (one-to-all), multicast (many-to-one), and network (many-to-many) communication systems. The definition of a message includes signals transmitted for control purposes. [Read more](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7378262/)
