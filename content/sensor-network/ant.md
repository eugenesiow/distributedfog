ANT is a practical wireless sensor network protocol running in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Designed for ultra-low power, ease of use, efficiency and scalability, ANT easily handles peer-to-peer, star, connected star, tree and fixed mesh topologies. 

ANT provides reliable data communications, flexible and adaptive network operation and cross-talk immunity. ANT protocol stack is extremely compact, requiring minimal microcontroller resources and considerably reduces system costs.

ANT provides carefree handling of the Physical, Network and Transport OSI layers. In addition, it incorporates key low-level security features that form the foundation for user-defined sophisticated network security implementations. ANT ensures adequate user control while considerably lightening computational burden in providing a simple yet effective wireless networking solution.

The interface between ANT and the Host application has been designed with the utmost simplicity in mind such that ANT can be easily and quickly implemented into new devices and applications. The encapsulation of the wireless protocol complexity within the ANT chipset vastly reduces the burden on the application host controller, allowing a low-cost 4-bit or 8-bit Microcontroller (MCU) to establish and maintain complex wireless networks. Data transfers can be scheduled in a deterministic or ad-hoc fashion. A burst mode allows for the efficient transfer of large amounts of stored data to and from a PC or other computing device.

A typical ANT-enabled device consists of an application host MCU interfaced with an ANT module, chipset or chip. The host MCU establishes and maintains a communication session to other remote ANT-enabled devices by means of a simple, bidirectional, serial message protocol. This document details the protocol and provides examples of how to use ANT for wireless networking.
