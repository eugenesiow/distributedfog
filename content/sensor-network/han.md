A home-area network (HAN) connects in-home digital devices, such as PCs, mobile phones, entertainment technology, thermostats, home security systems and smart appliances, into a common network. In the context of energy utilities, HAN is a means for utility companies to extend their reach beyond the meter, and to incorporate the “smart thermostat,” direct load control appliances, smart appliances and in-home energy display into utility systems, as well as to enable demand response (DR) and energy efficiency programs.
