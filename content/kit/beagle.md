##### BeagleBone

The BeagleBone is the low-cost, high-expansion focused BeagleBoard using a low cost Sitara AM335x Cortex A8 ARM processor from Texas Instruments. It is similar to the earlier BeagleBoards and can act as a USB or Ethernet connected expansion companion for your current BeagleBoard and BeagleBoard-xM or work stand-alone. The BeagleBone is small even by BeagleBoard standards and with the high-performance ARM capabilities you expect from a BeagleBoard, the BeagleBone brings full-featured Linux to places it has never gone before.

It is a lower-cost, high-expansion focused BeagleBoard using a low cost Sitara XAM3359AZCZ100 Cortex A8 ARM processor from Texas Instruments. It is similar to the Beaglebone,but with some features removed and some features added. [More](https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack)
