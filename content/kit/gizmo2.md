description: "Gizmo2 is the second generation open source x86 development board from GizmoSphere. Gizmo 2 provides the power of a high performance computer and the I/O capabilities of a microcontroller through the use of an AMD Embedded G-Series System-on-Chip (SOC). The board includes the AMD GX-210HA dual-core processor, combined on a single die with AMD Radeon HD 8210E discrete-class graphics, providing 85 GFLOPS performance while drawing only 9 watts TDP."

The new Gizmo 2 platform is the second-generation x86-based DIY single-board-computer (SBC) from Gizmosphere. Expanding on the community’s first platform, Gizmo 2 merges a 60 percent performance increase coupled with power-consumption decrease with direct access to a wide range of interfaces − GPIO, ADC/DAC, PWM, I2C, SPI, USB, SATA and PCIe – plus an updated selection of peripheral interfaces, including the much-requested HDMI dedicated port, an mSATA port for connecting SSDs, and a microSD card slot.

Built upon the CPU and GPU technology behind today’s leading video game consoles, data centers and PCs, and coupled with a complete open-source development ecosystem, the limitations of Gizmo 2 are only bound by your imagination.
