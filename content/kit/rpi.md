A mainstay in the world of makers and electronics, The Raspberry Pi is a single-board, low-cost, high-performance computer first developed in the UK by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Not only has it helped bring the joy of electronics and computer programming to people around the world, but it has also become a staple of the maker community. The ever-present Pi is now in its sixth iteration—[Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055)—as the Pi Foundation continues to improve on an already excellent product. There’s also the five-dollar [Pi Zero](https://www.adafruit.com/category/813) – a game-changing Raspberry Pi in a much smaller package – as well as its WiFi-laced cousin, the [Pi Zero W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400).

Since the release of the first Raspberry Pi, manifold products have been created to accompany, modify, and enhance the Pi’s capabilities. From [touchscreens](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/804) and [displays](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/400) to [HATs](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/405), [Bonnets](https://www.adafruit.com/category/929), [cameras](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/802) and [plates](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/406), the possibilities are endless when it comes to project ideas. We’ve also created a number of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/175) packs for young engineers and experts alike.
