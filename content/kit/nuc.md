##### Seventh Generation
Intel's seventh generation NUC models, codenamed Baby Canyon, are based on their Kaby Lake-U processors with a TDP from 15 W to 28 W. The most notable additions are HDMI 2.0 and USB 3.1 Type-C ports (with Thunderbolt 3 on i5 and i7 models). [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing#Seventh_generation)

##### Operating system support
NUCs support UEFI compatible operating systems, such as Windows, as well as most distributions of Linux. Additionally, they can be used for virtualization with VMware vSphere; multiple NUCs can be used together to create a home lab for learning purposes.
