[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. [Arduino boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products) are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the [Arduino programming language](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) (based on Wiring), and the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), based on [Processing](https://processing.org/).

Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge (the community [forum](http://forum.arduino.cc/)) that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats, and motion detectors. [Read More](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
