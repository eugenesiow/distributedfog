The IoT Landscape is a project to explain the various technologies across the Internet of Things. It is an evolving reference guide of IoT technologies started as means of sharing some of the things I've learned in my years of working on IoT research at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

The site is built and updated using the excellent [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site generator, written in Go, and site [source code](https://github.com/eugenesiow/distributedfog) is available on Github. The design is centered around a minimalistic card design and uses my custom style on top of [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) framework. Code is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
