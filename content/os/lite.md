Huawei also developed an open-source operating system for the IoT called [Huawei LiteOS](http://www.huawei.com/minisite/liteos/en/). This should not be confused with the University of Illinois [LiteOS project](http://lanterns.eecs.utk.edu/software/liteos/) for sensor nodes and is differentiated by calling it Huawei LiteOS.

LiteOS is an open source, interactive, UNIX-like operating system designed for wireless sensor networks. With the tools that come with LiteOS, you can operate one or more wireless sensor networks in a Unix-like manner, transferring data, installing programs, retrieving results, or configuring sensors. You can also develop programs for nodes, and wirelessly distribute such programs to sensor nodes. Development started in 2007. 

LiteOS is open source, written in C and runs on the Atmel AVR based MicaZ and IRIS sensor networking platform. According to the official release notes, this version is closely integrated with [AVR Studio 5.0](http://www.avr-tutorials.com/avr-studio-5/avr-studio-5). With the JTAG support which is natively built into this software, LiteOS allows debugging sensor network applications directly through JTAG and AVR Studio.

In 2015 chinese telecoms giant Huawei developed an embedded operating system for the IoT also named as LiteOS. The company says that its "LiteOS" is the "lightest" software of its kind and can be used to power a range of smart devices — from wearables to cars.  The operating system weighs in at just 10 kilobytes in size.  William Xu, Huawei’s head of strategy and marketing, said that the company wasn't interested in building its own internet-connected gadgets. "We want to provide the connections, not the devices," said Xu, according to a report in the Financial Times. He added that LiteOS was not an attempt to compete with smartphone operating systems like Android or iOS either, but would instead be used to power a range of gadgets — for both businesses and consumers. Xu gave the example of the electric toothbrush, saying a connected version would "record how often and how effectively you brush your teeth, and could tell you when to do it and how to do it better."
