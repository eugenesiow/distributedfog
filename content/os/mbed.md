Arm Mbed is the idea that the Internet of Things (IoT) is a collaboration between the people who make things, the people who use things and the people who make the services all these things use. Arm created a solution to help lead sustainable growth within the IoT and named it Mbed.

Mbed has a large community of developers, an ecosystem of open source IoT code, a network of hardware partners, and products and services that serve the IoT market. When we talk about the elements of Mbed together, we talk about the Arm Mbed IoT Device Platform: the Mbed OS developer community, Mbed OS, Mbed Device Connector Service, Mbed TLS, and Mbed Client.

##### Development

Applications for the mbed platform can be developed using the mbed online IDE, a free online code editor and compiler. Only a web browser needs to be installed on the local PC, since a project is compiled on the cloud, i.e. on a remote server, using the ARMCC C/C++ compiler. The mbed IDE provides private workspaces with ability to import, export, and share code with distributed Mercurial version control, and it can be used also for code documentation generation. Applications can be developed also with other development environments such as Keil ÂµVision, IAR Embedded Workbench, and Eclipse with GCC ARM Embedded tools.
