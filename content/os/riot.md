RIOT is an operating system designed for the particular requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. These requirements comprise a low memory footprint, high energy efficiency, real-time capabilities, a modular and configurable communication stack, and support for a wide range of low-power devices. RIOT provides a microkernel, utilities like cryptographic libraries, data structures (bloom filters, hash tables, priority queues), a shell, various network stacks, and support for various microcontrollers, radio drivers, sensors, and configurations for entire platforms, e.g. TelosB or STM32 Discovery Boards.

The microkernel itself comprises thread management, a priority-based scheduler, a powerful API for inter-process communication (IPC), a system timer, and mutexes. [Read more](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Introduction)
