[ECG](https://imotions.com/blog/what-is-ecg/) records the electrical activity generated by heart muscle depolarizations, which propagate in pulsating electrical waves towards the skin. Although the electricity amount is in fact very small, it can be picked up reliably with ECG electrodes attached to the skin (data unit: microvolt, uV). The full ECG setup comprises at least four electrodes which are placed on the chest or both arms and legs.

ECG electrodes are typically wet sensors, requiring the use of a conductive gel to increase conductivity between skin and electrodes.
