##### Paper Abstract
Fog computing is an emerging technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) that aims to support processing on resource-constrained distributed nodes in between the sensors and actuators on the ground and compute clusters in the cloud. Fog Computing benefits from low latency, location awareness, mobility, wide-spread deployment and geographical distribution at the edge of the network. However, there is a need to investigate, optimise for and measure the performance, scalability and interoperability of resource-constrained Fog nodes running real-time applications and queries on streaming IoT data before we can realise these benefits. With Eywa, a novel Fog Computing infrastructure, we

- formally define and implement a means of distribution and control of query workload with an inverse publish-subscribe and push mechanism,
- show how data can be integrated and made interoperable through organising data as Linked Data in the Resource Description Format (RDF),
- test if we can improve RDF Stream Processing query performance and scalability over state-of-the-art engines with our approach to query translation and distribution for a published IoT benchmark on resource-constrained nodes and 
- position Fog Computing within the Internet of the Future.
