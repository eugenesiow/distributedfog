### What is Thingiverse?

MakerBot's Thingiverse is a thriving design community for discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. As the world's largest 3D printing community, we believe that everyone should be encouraged to create and remix 3D things, no matter their technical expertise or previous experience. In the spirit of maintaining an open platform, all designs are encouraged to be licensed under a Creative Commons license, meaning that anyone can use or alter any design.

##### Make

We need your brilliant designs. Get on a 3D modeling program and/or 3D scanner and start to create, construct, and innovate! Build something cool, useful, or just fun. Then upload the file to Thingiverse and tell us all about it.

##### Share

Show us what you made: the world wants to see it! 3D modeling and printing is still in its infancy. The more you share your work, the more your designs inspire others, get printed, and do awesome things.

##### Discover

The Thingiverse community has uploaded over 947,150 3D models, and that number is growing every day. Check out all the incredible objects people have created, and get inspired to make your own! [Read more](https://www.thingiverse.com/about/)
