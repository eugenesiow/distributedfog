      <description>GPS provides geolocation and time information to a receiver anywhere on or near the Earth. It does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception.  Wikipedia     Research Stanford GPS Lab, Supply Chains, Indoor Navigation
 
Alternatives GLONASS is the most developed of the GPS alternatives, and is operated by Russia.

      <description>A gyroscope is a type of sensor useful for measuring orientation. Electronic, microchip-packaged MEMS gyroscopes are commonly found in consumer electronics devices.  Wikipedia     Research Health: Fall Detection, Hand Tremor
 
Accelerometers Though similar in purpose they measure different things. Gyroscopes determine orientation while accelerometers measure non-gravitational acceleration.
 
Inexpensive vibrating structure microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes have become widely available. These are packaged similarly to other integrated circuits and may provide either analog or digital outputs.</description>

      <description>A pedometer is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person&amp;#39;s hands or hips.  Wikipedia     Research Comparing 13 Pedometer Models, Accuracy for Children, How Many Steps Per Day?, Intensity Classification
 
Popular Devices Fitbit, Apple Watch, Nike+, iPod Nano
 
The technology for a pedometer includes a mechanical sensor and software to count steps.</description>
