      <description>The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that &amp;#39;the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,&amp;#39; and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things. The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 (LR-WPAN) based networks.

      <description>The ISM radio bands are radio bands (portions of the radio spectrum) reserved internationally for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial, scientific and medical purposes other than telecommunications. Examples of applications in these bands include radio-frequency process heating, microwave ovens, and medical diathermy machines. The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices were limited to certain bands of frequencies.</description>

      <description>Zigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs, designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection.  Wikipedia     IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 is a technical standard which defines the operation of low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).</description>

      <description>mDNS resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS).  Wikipedia     Zeroconf It is a set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on TCP/IP when computers or network peripherals are interconnected.</description>

      <description>A hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices. µPnP provides support for: driver development, automatic integration of third-party peripherals, discovery and remote access to peripheral services.  μPnP     Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) applications require diverse sensors and actuators. However, contemporary IoT devices provide limited support for the integration of third-party peripherals. To tackle this problem, we introduce μPnP: a hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices.</description>
