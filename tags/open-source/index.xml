      <description>Beagles are low-cost, fan-less single-board computers based on low-power Texas Instruments processors featuring the ARM Cortex-A series core with all of the expandability of today&amp;#39;s desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. Initially, development was targeted at enabling Linux distributions to improve support for ARM devices.  BeagleBoard.org     BeagleBone VS BeagleBone Black

      <description>Gizmo2 is the second generation open source x86 development board from GizmoSphere. Gizmo 2 provides the power of a high performance computer and the I/O capabilities of a microcontroller through the use of an AMD Embedded G-Series System-on-Chip (SOC). The board includes the AMD GX-210HA dual-core processor, combined on a single die with AMD Radeon HD 8210E discrete-class graphics, providing 85 GFLOPS performance while drawing only 9 watts TDP.  element14     The new Gizmo 2 platform is the second-generation x86-based DIY single-board-computer (SBC) from Gizmosphere.</description>
