      <description>Motion-powered charging involves the transformation of naturally occurring motion in the form of kinetic energy into electricity which can be used to charge batteries and power electronic devices.   Research Copenhagen Wheel, Vint Cerf&amp;rsquo;s Taking the Internet to the Next Physical Level, Self-charging Textile
 
Ampy Move is a wearable motion-charger that transforms the kinetic energy from motion into power for smartphone and wearables. Inductors in the Move device transform movement into usable power to charge devices.</description>
