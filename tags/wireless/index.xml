      <description>The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that &amp;#39;the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,&amp;#39; and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things. The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 (LR-WPAN) based networks.  Wikipedia     Thread Thread is a standard suggested by Nest Labs based on IEEE 802.</description>

      <description>Infrared radiation, or simply infrared or IR, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore invisible, although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light. IR data transmission is employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants.  Wikipedia     IrDA IrDA refers to a complete set of protocols for wireless infrared communications. The main reason for using IrDA had been wireless data transfer over the “last one meter” using point-and-shoot principles.</description>
