      <description>Air pollution sensors are devices that detect and monitor the presence of air pollution of the environment. The majority focuses on components: ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide.  Wikipedia     Research Array of Things
 
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. Such particles are able to bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.</description>

      <description>Temperature sensors are commonly used sensors that detect Temperature or heat.  Wikipedia     Common Types &amp;hellip;  Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor
 Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)
 Thermocouple
 Semiconductor-based sensors
   
The silicon bandgap temperature sensor is an extremely common form of temperature sensor (thermometer) used in electronic equipment. Its main advantage is that it can be included in a silicon integrated circuit at very low cost.</description>
