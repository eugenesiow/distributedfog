      <description>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe), reliability and security.  Wikipedia     Architecture 
 
Network Protocol 
 
AMQP is a binary, application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns. It provides flow controlled, message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as at-most-once (where each message is delivered once or never), at-least-once (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may do so multiple times) and exactly-once (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once), and authentication and/or encryption based on SASL and/or TLS.</description>

      <description>The Data Distribution Service for real-time systems (DDS) is an Object Management Group (OMG) machine-to-machine (sometimes called middleware) standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high-performance and interoperable data exchanges using a publishâ€“subscribe pattern. DDS addresses the needs of applications like financial trading, air-traffic control, smart grid management, and other big data applications. The standard is used in applications such as smartphone operating systems, transportation systems and vehicles, software-defined radio, and by healthcare providers.</description>
