      <description>The Sensor Instance Registry (SIR) is a web service interface for managing sensor catalogues. It is based on the OGC discussion paper 10-171 and 09-163r2 (SensorML discovery profile) and presents a pragmatic solution that may serve as the basis for further discussion and development. The paper contains extensive descriptions of the service operations (requests and responses) for GET and POST requests.  52north.org     SensorML discovery profile (Paper) This Discussion Paper describes the mapping of sensor metadata encoded following SensorML specification 1.</description>

      <description>A centralized infrastructure that allows registration of sensors. Employs &amp;#39;digrectory&amp;#39; to handle different resources. Each directory is attached to a particular communication technology, such as NFC, IPv6 etc. A mobile app enables users to discover and access sensors. Discovery mechanism takes advantage of geolocation and context awareness.  WoT Group     Architecture
