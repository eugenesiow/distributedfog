      <description>ANGELS is a work in progress research project that explores the idea of utilising smart edge devices for performing certain portions of the data analysis tasks in IoT.  Wikipedia     Abstract The current global emphasis on “Internet of Things (IoT)” have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems.” The technology has the potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today.</description>

      <description>Ceph is a free-software storage platform that implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, and provides interfaces for object-, block- and file-level storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.

      <description>FusionFS is a distributed filesystem that co-exists with current parallel filesystems in High-End Computing, optimized for both a subset of HPC and Many-Task Computing workloads. FusionFS is a user-level filesystem that runs on the compute resource infrastructure, and enables every compute node to actively participate in the metadata and data management. Distributed metadata management is implemented using ZHT, a zero-hop distributed hashtable.  datasys.cs.iit.edu     Abstract State-of-the-art, yet decades-old, architecture of high-performance computing systems has its compute and storage resources separated.</description>

      <description>The integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) is open source data management software used by research organizations and government agencies worldwide. iRODS is released as a production-level distribution aimed at deployment in mission critical environments. It virtualizes data storage resources, so users can take control of their data, regardless of where and on what device the data is stored. As data volumes grow and data services become more complex, iRODS is serving an increasingly important role in data management.</description>
