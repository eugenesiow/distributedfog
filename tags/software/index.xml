      <description>ANGELS is a work in progress research project that explores the idea of utilising smart edge devices for performing certain portions of the data analysis tasks in IoT.  Wikipedia     Abstract The current global emphasis on “Internet of Things (IoT)” have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems.” The technology has the potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today.</description>

      <description>Calvin is an application environment that lets things talk to things. It comprises of both a development framework for IoT application developers, and a runtime environment which handles the running application. Calvin is based on the fundamental idea that application development should be simple and fun. There should be no unnecessary impediments between an idea and its implementation, and an app developer should not have to worry about communication protocols or hardware specifics (but will not stop you from doing it if you want to.</description>

      <description>Hermes is a distributed, eventbased middleware platform. Hermes follows a type- and attribute-based publish/subscribe model that places particular emphasis on programming language integration by supporting type-checking of event data and event type inheritance. To handle dynamic, large-scale environments, Hermes uses peer-to-peer techniques for autonomic management of its overlay network of event brokers and for scalable event dissemination.  Pietzuch (2004). Hermes: A scalable event-based middleware. PhD Thesis.     A primary feature of the Hermes event-based middleware is scalability, as it is targeted at the development of large-scale distributed systems.</description>
