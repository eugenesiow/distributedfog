      <description>DNS-SD allows clients to discover a named list of service instances, given a service type, and to resolve those services to hostnames using standard DNS queries. The specification is compatible with existing unicast DNS server and client software, but works equally well with Multicast DNS in a zero-configuration environment.  Wikipedia     Zeroconf It is a set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on TCP/IP when computers or network peripherals are interconnected.</description>

      <description>Group communication involves a one-to-many relationship between CoAP endpoints. Specifically, a single CoAP client can simultaneously get (or set) resources from multiple CoAP servers using CoAP over IP multicast. CoAP is a web transfer protocol based on Representational State Transfer (REST) for resource constrained devices operating in an IP network.  RFC 7390     In M2M applications, for example, home or building automation, there is a need for local clients and servers to find and interact with each other without human intervention.</description>

      <description>The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on the Internet Protocol Suite for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information. It accomplishes this without assistance of server-based configuration mechanisms, such as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static configuration of a network host.  Wikipedia     The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) provides a mechanism where by network clients, with little or no static configuration, can discover network services.</description>

      <description>Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other&amp;#39;s presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment.  Wikipedia     Protocol UPnP assumes the network must run Internet Protocol (IP) and then leverages HTTP, SOAP and XML on top of IP, in order to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and eventing.</description>

      <description>mDNS resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS).  Wikipedia     Zeroconf It is a set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on TCP/IP when computers or network peripherals are interconnected.</description>

      <description>A hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices. µPnP provides support for: driver development, automatic integration of third-party peripherals, discovery and remote access to peripheral services.  μPnP     Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) applications require diverse sensors and actuators. However, contemporary IoT devices provide limited support for the integration of third-party peripherals. To tackle this problem, we introduce μPnP: a hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices.</description>
