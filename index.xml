Network Protocol 
 
AMQP is a binary, application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns. It provides flow controlled, message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as at-most-once (where each message is delivered once or never), at-least-once (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may do so multiple times) and exactly-once (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once), and authentication and/or encryption based on SASL and/or TLS.</description>

      <description>In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where multicast traffic is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.  IETF.org Draft     Introduction The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility.</description>

      <description>Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3, and has since been refined to support higher bit rates and longer link distances.  Wikipedia     IEEE 802.3 IEEE 802.3 is a working group and a collection of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards produced by the working group defining the physical layer and data link layer&amp;rsquo;s media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.</description>

      <description>A hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices. µPnP provides support for: driver development, automatic integration of third-party peripherals, discovery and remote access to peripheral services.  μPnP     Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) applications require diverse sensors and actuators. However, contemporary IoT devices provide limited support for the integration of third-party peripherals. To tackle this problem, we introduce μPnP: a hardware and software solution for plug-and-play integration of embedded peripherals with IoT devices.</description>

      <description>The IoT Landscape is a project to explain the various technologies across the Internet of Things. It is an evolving reference guide of IoT technologies started as means of sharing some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my years of working on IoT research at the University of Southampton.
The site is built and updated using the excellent Hugo static site generator, written in Go, and site source code is available on Github.</description>

      <description>A hydraulic actuator consists of cylinder or fluid motor that uses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation. The mechanical motion gives an output in terms of linear, rotatory or oscillatory motion. As liquids are nearly impossible to compress, a hydraulic actuator can exert a large force. The drawback of this approach is its limited acceleration.  Wikipedia     Advantages  Hydraulic actuators are rugged and suited for high-force applications.</description>

      <description>Piezoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins) in response to applied mechanical stress. The word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure and heat. A piezoelectric bimorph is a cantilever used for actuation or sensing which consists of two active layers. One active layer contracts and the other expands if voltage is applied, thus the bimorph bends.</description>

It usually includes a built-in encoder or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect. The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters.
