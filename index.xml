      <guid>http://distributedfog.com/app-protocol/coap/</guid>
      <description>CoAP is a specialised web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  RFC 7252     Research HTTP/2, CoAP on device HTTP/2 everywhere else, Security, Californium Cloud Services, MQTT vs CoAP, TinyOS Performance, Transport: Logistics
 
CoAP is network-oriented protocol with similar features to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. CoAP operates over UDP (simpler) instead of TCP compensating for unreliability with a retransmission mechanism.</description>

      <guid>http://distributedfog.com/power/energy-harvesting/</guid>
      <description>Energy harvesting or scavenging is the process by which ambient energy is derived from external sources, captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices.  Wikipedia     Research Parametric Excitation, Energy Harvesting Technologies Book, Wireless Energy Harvesting, Comparison
 
Makers Solar Harvesting Project, Pieze, Wurth, Energy Harvesting Designs for the IoT
 
All processes that involve energy conversion are, to some degree, inefficient. Motors get hot, as do power transistors, automobile engines, and light bulbs; in each case energy is wasted as heat.</description>

      <guid>http://distributedfog.com/app-protocol/mqtt/</guid>
      <description>MQTT is a publish-subscribe-based lightweight messaging protocol for use on top of TCP/IP. It is designed for connections where a small code footprint is required or the network bandwidth is limited.  Wikipedia     Research CoAP vs MQTT, MQTT and REST, Push Notifications, Secure MQTT
 
MQTT-SN is a variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP networks, such as ZigBee. As it does not require the TCP/IP stack, it can be used over a serial link where overhead is really small or over UDP.</description>

      <description>Electrocardiography is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin.  Wikipedia     Research Health: Smart Healthcare, Arrhythmia Detection, Low-cost Monitoring, Real-time Monitoring
 
Maker Hackster: RPi+Azure+AD8232, Hackaday: Arduino+ECGShield
 
ECG records the electrical activity generated by heart muscle depolarizations, which propagate in pulsating electrical waves towards the skin. Although the electricity amount is in fact very small, it can be picked up reliably with ECG electrodes attached to the skin (data unit: microvolt, uV).</description>
