      <description>ANGELS is a work in progress research project that explores the idea of utilising smart edge devices for performing certain portions of the data analysis tasks in IoT.  Wikipedia     Abstract The current global emphasis on “Internet of Things (IoT)” have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems.” The technology has the potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today.</description>

      <description>A cloudlet is a mobility-enhanced small-scale cloud datacenter that is located at the edge of the Internet. The main purpose of the cloudlet is supporting resource-intensive and interactive mobile applications by providing powerful computing resources to mobile devices with lower latency. It is a new architectural element that extends today’s cloud computing infrastructure.  Wikipedia     Cloudlet VS Cloud There is significant overlap in the requirements for cloud and cloudlet.</description>

      <description>Eywa is an interoperable fog computing infrastructure for RDF Stream Processing (RSP). It implements a means of distribution and control of query workload for stream processing on flexible, interopeable, RDF graph structures.  eugenesiow.com     Paper Abstract Fog computing is an emerging technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) that aims to support processing on resource-constrained distributed nodes in between the sensors and actuators on the ground and compute clusters in the cloud.</description>
