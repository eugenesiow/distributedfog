      <description>Android Things (codenamed/rebranded from Brillo) is an Android-based embedded operating system platform by Google. It is aimed to be used with low-power and memory constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are usually built from different microcontroller platforms.  Wikipedia     Like updates for Android Phones, developers can push Google-provided OS updates and custom app updates using the same over-the-air infrastructure that Google uses for its products and services.</description>
